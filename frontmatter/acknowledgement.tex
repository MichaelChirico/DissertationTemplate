\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

It is with deep reverence for their patience, persistence and perspicacity that I extend my gratitude first and foremost to my committee: Holger Sieg, Hanming Fang, Matthew Steinberg, and Petra Todd. I have also benefitted enormously professionally from the guidance and insight of other coauthors: Rebecca Maynard, Charles Loeffler, Robert Inman, John MacDonald, and Seth Flaxman.

My progression as a researcher also owes an eternal debt to my ever-inquisitive workplace proximity associates read: dearest friends, Pau Pereira Batlle, Gustavo Camilo, Wendy Castillo, Alberto Ciancio, and Juan-Manuel Hernandez. My continued (relative) mental stability is due to them as well as to my other wonderful friends I have made in this city I love -- Daniel Wills, Constanza Vergara, Ana Gazmuri, Alix Barasch, Cinthia Konichi, Pedro Olea, and Duna Gylfadottir.

Before the music starts I also need to give a big shoutout of profound unconditional love to my ever-supportive beautiful mess of a family -- Ma, Mike, Dad, Sharon, Grandma, Grandpa, Chris, Alyssa, Mark, Brett, Jeremy, Dev, Bryana, y'all're crazy and I love every minute of it.
