# Penn dissertation template

This is a template for a Penn Economics/Finance/AppliedEcon style dissertation.

The main file is `dissertation.tex`. Add packages and custom formatting in `preamble.tex`. Front matter (the abstract, copyright notice, dedication, and acknowledgements), are in the folder `frontmatter`. 

Include your paper contents (excluding the preamble, of course), where `chapterX.tex` is currently, replacing `\input{chapter1.tex}` with your own work.

Check the [university's style guidelines](http://guides.library.upenn.edu/dissertation_manual/formatting) to adjust for changes.
